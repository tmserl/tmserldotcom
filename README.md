## How it started

The year is 2022, I've accumulated almost as many social media accounts and websites as I've had hot dinners. If _I'm_ struggling to keep tabs of all of them, then how could I expect anyone else to?

I had a look at what options were available. Advertised as 'the only link you'll ever need', [Linktree](https://linktr.ee) looked like a good option. It allows you to add all of your social accounts and sites to your very own linktr.ee URL.

One of the downsides to Linktree is that your page ends up looking like everyone else's. Not only that, but if you wanted further customisation controls, or in-depth analytics, you start having to spend between £4-£19 a month.

## Solution

Not being satisfied with the options available online, I decided to build my own 'Linktree' style website. Built using React, the site uses custom CSS styling and modern React Hooks to signpost users to different sites and social platforms. The site is deployed on Netlify and takes advantage of their GitHub CI/CD integration, and, because of it being self-hosted, I get to pick my own domain name, rather than being limited to ones beginning with _linktr.ee_.
